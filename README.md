# Silent Crash in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Node.js HTTP servers that can lead to silent crashes without informative error messages. The server handles requests but abruptly stops functioning without any indication of the root cause.  Debugging this type of error can be very challenging due to the lack of useful diagnostic information.
